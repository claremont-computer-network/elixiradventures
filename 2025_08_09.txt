I identified the hello_elixir.ex file. Within the hello_elixir.ex file I was able to identify the definition of the HelloWorld class and its corresponding hello method which printed out the `:world` string.

At first I tried to create a claremont method which prints `:computer-network`. However I recieved the following error:

" iex -S mix

== Compilation error in file lib/hello_elixir.ex ==
** (CompileError) lib/hello_elixir.ex: cannot compile module HelloElixir (errors have been logged)

After some modifications I was able to output the following:
