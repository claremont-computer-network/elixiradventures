I was curious what the `:` operator represented, and then I realized that I still did not understand the structure of a method definition in Elixir.

So I queried on Google: "method definitions in elixir" and clicked on the first link after the AI summary:

https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/functions

This page provided examples using zero, one, and two parameters in an Elixir method which composes a print statement.

I felt that this was a satisfactory next step as I pick back up from where I left off on 2025/08/09 (2 days ago now without coding in Elixir) and in search of purpose or structure.
